# Simple text editor

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

## Notes

- Text sample is given in `text.service.js`
- Given files structure is not obligatory and could be changed
- This is the solution for the test task for Senior Frontend Engineer at [Agile Engine](https://agileengine.com/) ðŸ˜Š.
